# TODO - Fix TypeScript Compilation Error

## Steps to Complete:

- [x] Fix `Backend/src/lib/api.ts` - Add proper PropertyStatus type assertions
- [x] Fix `Backend/src/components/similar-properties.tsx` - Use spread operator instead of manual object creation
- [x] Test the build to verify the fix
- [x] Verify application functionality
- [x] Apply user's corrected solution

## Progress:
- [x] Identified the root cause: Manual object creation instead of using spread operator from currentProperty
- [x] Created plan to fix the issue
- [x] Fixed `Backend/src/lib/api.ts` - Added PropertyStatus import and type assertions for all status fields
- [x] Applied user's corrected solution with proper spread operator pattern
- [x] Added version marker `__SIMILAR_PROPS_VERSION = "v3-fix-dedup"` for deployment tracking
- [x] Build test successful - TypeScript compilation error resolved!
- [x] Changes committed and pushed to trigger Vercel redeploy

## ✅ TASK COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY

The TypeScript compilation error has been fixed using the user's corrected approach:

**Key Solution Points:**
1. **Always start with spread operator**: `...currentProperty` to inherit all properties with correct types
2. **Never manually set status/propertyType/listingType**: These are inherited from the source property
3. **Only override safe fields**: id, title, description, price, coordinates, images, etc.
4. **Proper type safety**: No manual type assertions needed - types are inherited correctly

**Final Implementation:**
```typescript
const base: Property[] = [
  {
    ...currentProperty, // Inherit ALL properties with correct types
    id: 'similar-1',
    title: 'Casa moderna con jardín',
    price: Math.round((currentProperty.price ?? 0) * 0.85),
    // status, propertyType, listingType inherited automatically
  }
];
```

**Why This Works:**
- Spread operator ensures exact Property interface compliance
- No string literals that could cause type mismatches
- All enum values (PropertyStatus, PropertyType, ListingType) inherited correctly
- Version marker helps identify compilation issues in deployment

The Next.js build now completes successfully without any TypeScript compilation errors.
