# TODO - Fix TypeScript Compilation Error

## Steps to Complete:

- [x] Fix `Backend/src/lib/api.ts` - Add proper PropertyStatus type assertions
- [x] Check and fix other files with similar status string issues
- [x] Test the build to verify the fix
- [x] Verify application functionality

## Progress:
- [x] Identified the root cause: string literals instead of PropertyStatus types in mock data
- [x] Created plan to fix the issue
- [x] Fixed `Backend/src/lib/api.ts` - Added PropertyStatus import and type assertions for all status fields
- [x] Build test successful - TypeScript compilation error resolved!

## âœ… TASK COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY

The TypeScript compilation error has been fixed. The Next.js build now completes successfully without any type errors.
