# TODO: Fix Prisma SQLite Compatibility Issue

## Steps to Complete:

- [ ] Fix SQLite compatibility by removing `@db.Date` annotation from PaymentAnalytics model
- [ ] Test Prisma generation with `prisma generate`
- [ ] Verify npm install works without errors
- [ ] Optional: Apply schema changes to database with `prisma db push`

## Issue Details:
- **Error**: Native type Date is not supported for sqlite connector
- **Location**: Backend/prisma/schema.prisma:328
- **Field**: `date DateTime @db.Date` in PaymentAnalytics model
- **Solution**: Remove `@db.Date` annotation (SQLite doesn't support native type annotations)

## Progress:
- [x] Analyzed the issue and created plan
- [x] Fix the schema file - Removed `@db.Date` annotation from PaymentAnalytics.date field
- [x] Test the fix with `prisma generate` - ✅ SUCCESS
- [x] Verify npm install works without errors - ✅ SUCCESS

## ✅ ALL ISSUES RESOLVED SUCCESSFULLY!

Both the original SQLite compatibility issue and the subsequent MercadoPago dependency issue have been completely fixed. The build process now works without errors.

## Additional Fix Applied:
- **MercadoPago Dependency**: Installed missing `mercadopago` package to resolve build compilation error
- **Build Verification**: Successfully ran `npm run build` without any errors
