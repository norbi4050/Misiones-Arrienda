plan# TODO: Fix TypeScript Compilation Error in similar-properties.tsx

## Steps to Complete:

- [x] Fix the `generateMockSimilarProperties` function in `Backend/src/components/similar-properties.tsx`
  - [x] Add explicit status assignment with valid PropertyStatus enum values
  - [x] Ensure type safety for all mock properties
  - [x] Remove reliance on spread operator for status property

- [x] Test the build to ensure TypeScript error is resolved
- [x] Clean up temporary files
- [x] Verify similar properties display correctly (optional)
- [x] Check for other potential status type issues in codebase (optional)

## Current Status:
✅ **COMPLETED** - TypeScript compilation error has been successfully fixed!

### Changes Made:
1. **Fixed `generateMockSimilarProperties` function** in `Backend/src/components/similar-properties.tsx`
   - **Removed spread operator dependency**: Instead of using `...currentProperty` which copied potentially incompatible string values, each property is now explicitly defined
   - **Explicit type safety**: Used `status: 'AVAILABLE' as const` to ensure TypeScript recognizes the literal type
   - **Complete property definition**: All required Property interface fields are now explicitly set with proper fallback values
   - **Type-safe approach**: Follows community best practices for union literal types vs enums

2. **Build Test Passed** ✅
   - Ran `npm run build` successfully without any TypeScript errors
   - The original error about incompatible status types has been completely resolved
   - No more "Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'PropertyStatus'" errors

3. **File Cleanup** ✅
   - Removed temporary troubleshooting files
   - Ensured clean project structure

### Technical Details:
- **Root Cause**: The spread operator `...currentProperty` was copying all properties including `status`, but `currentProperty.status` was a generic string that didn't match the `PropertyStatus` union type (`'AVAILABLE' | 'RENTED' | 'SOLD' | 'MAINTENANCE' | 'RESERVED'`)
- **Solution Applied**: Completely eliminated the spread operator and explicitly defined each property with proper types and fallback values
- **Type Safety**: Used `'AVAILABLE' as const` to ensure TypeScript correctly infers the literal type instead of generic string
- **Community Best Practice**: Followed the recommended approach of using union literal types with explicit assignments

### Final Result:
The TypeScript compilation error has been completely resolved. The application can now build and deploy successfully without any type errors related to the PropertyStatus enum. The solution follows TypeScript best practices and ensures type safety throughout the component.
