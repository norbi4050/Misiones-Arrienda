# TODO - Fix TypeScript Compilation Error

## Steps to Complete:

- [x] Fix `Backend/src/lib/api.ts` - Add proper PropertyStatus type assertions
- [x] Fix `Backend/src/components/similar-properties.tsx` - Use spread operator instead of manual object creation
- [x] Test the build to verify the fix
- [x] Verify application functionality

## Progress:
- [x] Identified the root cause: Manual object creation instead of using spread operator from currentProperty
- [x] Created plan to fix the issue
- [x] Fixed `Backend/src/lib/api.ts` - Added PropertyStatus import and type assertions for all status fields
- [x] Fixed `Backend/src/components/similar-properties.tsx` - Removed PropertyStatus import and used spread operator
- [x] Build test successful - TypeScript compilation error resolved!

## âœ… TASK COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY

The TypeScript compilation error has been fixed using the proper approach:
1. Removed PropertyStatus import from similar-properties.tsx
2. Used spread operator (...currentProperty) to inherit all properties including correct types
3. Only override specific fields needed for mock data
4. This ensures type safety without manual type assertions

The Next.js build now completes successfully without any type errors.
